The key to selling stuff isn’t actually having a logical product that makes sense… oh no.

It’s emotions… and I’ll tell you why.

**I’m going to use Tai Lopez’s famous advertising campaign everyone knows as an example:**

Tai starts off his ad saying “everyone always asks me”

Immediately he catches his audiences attention by providing social proof, a very power emotional factor in increasing trust.

Then he subliminally uses materialistic possessions and walks around, what he is doing here is promoting his lifestyle… because this is a lifestyle business (and I’ll explain why this has so much to do with emotions down further)

And follows up by offering 3 steps to success (Immediately actionable call to action, powerful to have an ACTIONABLE CTA)

“A&nbsp;lifestyle business&nbsp;is a&nbsp;business&nbsp;set up and run by its founders primarily with the aim of sustaining a particular level of income and no more; or to provide a foundation from which to enjoy a particular&nbsp;lifestyle”&nbsp;

What Tai Lopez did was essentially teach people how to make money, thus making money himself…. then used it to rent out his place, and buy super cars

(Let me finish this blog post before you say omg, Tai Lopez is a scammer !)

This is the essence of a lifestyle business. You’ve seen it, I’ve seen it.

Okay… so why a lifestyle business works so well?

Emotions.

There’s never been an easier business model.

See the “self help guru” type of “lifestyle business” is insanely easy because you’re essentially selling your customers their own dreams. Being rich and being able to afford that Lamborghini and house.

You are essentially targeting your customers pain points (emotionally) selling your own customers their dreams (solving a problem, which is where the value behind your price point comes from) providing proof (materialistic possessions) and boom…

7 figures.

**Why Emotions Sell And Logic Doesn’t**

Because humans are bred to be in “fight or flight” mode ever since the cavemen days. We’re an extremely emotional “species”.

There’s actual science behind marketing, and the science is humans think emotionally before they think logically.

They make impulse buys before logical buys.<figure class="wp-block-image">

_M_

**Let me use an example:**

You’re upset from something, and you’re with your girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband

You know your mood is sour and you’re taking it out on your “other”

You eventually cause a fight knowing you shouldn’t have, even though logically you know tomorrow you’ll either have said sorry or you just ruined your tomorrow if your unlucky

But you still did it, why?

Because your a human, you think emotionally, not logically.

Long story short…. according to neuroscience, you NEED to be marketing towards emotions, rather than logic.
