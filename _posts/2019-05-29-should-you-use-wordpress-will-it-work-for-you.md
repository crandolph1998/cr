WordPress is widely used by all kinds of entrepreneurs, in all kinds of markets and niches.

**The real question is: should you use WordPress?**

Will it work for your business?

Is it good for more than just a blog?

The answer to this, in short is yes.

WordPress has evolved well outside of &#8220;just a blog&#8221;.

You can do nearly anything with it, such as&#8230;

  * Blogging (duh)
  * Membership sites
  * Sales funnels
  * Full blown sites (page builders, [such as OptimizePress](https://optimizepress.com))
  * eCommerce
  * Literally anything you could do on nearly any other platform

With WordPress&#8217;s plugin system, you can piece together about anything you&#8217;d want.

(But make sure the plugins you use are secure, don&#8217;t just use anything.)

Sure, it takes a bit of tweaking but once you&#8217;ve invested a wee bit of time into it, you&#8217;re golden.

It&#8217;s been around forever, it&#8217;s here to stay, and more importantly it&#8217;s free and open source.

**So, to answer the ultimate question&#8230;**

Sure, use WordPress.

It&#8217;s about just as good as anything else you could find.

It&#8217;s here to stay.

And with some minor tweaks, you can do nearly anything you want.

All you need to get started is a cheap (but quality) webhost such as [BlueHost.](https://www.coltonrandolph.com/bh)

They even have a one click installer for WordPress, so you literally don&#8217;t have to touch any code.

You&#8217;ll have your WordPress site up in running in no time.

Get at it, tiger. ðŸ™‚

(NOTE: Will be making a WordPress site quick start guide, page speed improving guide, and tweaking guide soon, stay tuned.)
