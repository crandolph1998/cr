Hi, [I&#8217;m Colton Randolph](https://coltonrandolph.com/my-story), A.K.A the founder of Cart Grab.

I started out online, with a Yoga eCommerce store.

That, right there, was my first successful online venture.

Struggling myself, figuring out problems I had, I created my own software to solve my own problems.

Thus, the birth of Cart Grab.

(Demo video above for example of what Cart Grab did &#8212; if you&#8217;re unfamiliar.)

Cart Grab was released to my email list, and following that I built through Ecom Blitz, a membership site based around eCommerce training.

[It was an eCommerce store platform](https://www.cartgrab.com), with a unique twist, a sales funnel focus.

After the initial product launch, it continued to thrive through webinars.

I would bundle Cart Grab up with the eCommerce funnel system, which was another product of mine, a higher ticket information product.

We had accumulated hundreds of users from this, profitably competing with the big dogs like Shopify.

**Everything was going great.**

Until I realized I was no longer selling physical products myself, while teaching about selling physical products.

Ironic, huh?

Basically, this lead to me feeling unauthentic.

While the information I was teaching was stuff I had learned from my time selling physical products, and was valid, I was no longer doing it anymore and still teaching people how to do it.

After about the 1st of January 2018, I was unhappy doing this at this point.

I needed to be more authentic.

I realized more than anything, I&#8217;m actively doing digital marketing, and selling digital products.

Therefore, **I am shutting down Cart Grab to focus on more authentic ventures**, ones that better represent me, and producing products that I myself could use and benefit from.

I&#8217;m moving away from physical products, to digital products. My software, products, services, and content will reflect that.

And in the process, I&#8217;m closing Cart Grab to focus on my other ventures.

While there&#8217;s a possibility Cart Grab 2.0 could be a thing in the future, for right now I&#8217;m closing it indefinitely until I have more time on my hands.

I&#8217;m a big believer in focus. I can&#8217;t do that balancing several major projects at the same time.

It was a great learning experience, and I don&#8217;t regret the investment or time by any means.

It still stands as a perfect case study of how anyone (aka this guy) can use digital marketing to grow about any business in any niche.

And, while I&#8217;m at it I want to give a sincere thank you to the following past Cart Grab team members:

  * Warren Brown
  * Ivan Skorodumov
  * Kassandra Milani Salvador

I also want to sincerely thank all of the Cart Grab community, and any Cart Grab user and customer. I appreciate your support.

That&#8217;s the end of that!

New, better, improved products, and services coming from me in the future.

Stay tuned!
