Running a Shopify store is hard.

You know whats harder than just running a Shopify store?

Running one with no definitive clue on who your selling to, and what your selling.

Trying to be Amazon or Walmart just won&#8217;t cut it for small businesses.

## You need to niche down to survive.

In short, always select a specific niche, that way you know exactly who your selling to.

If your not selling to a specific audience, your selling to no one!

Don&#8217;t make that mistake ðŸ™‚

Select a niche, dig in, and grow like crazy instead.
