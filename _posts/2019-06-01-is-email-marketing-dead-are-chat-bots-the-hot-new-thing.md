Ever since chat bots hit the scene, every marketer has been screaming about how email is dead.

Which, is partially true.

It&#8217;s not dead, but it&#8217;s not as engaging as it used to be.

**I mean&#8230; think about it, how many emails do you get in a day?**

How many junk emails that you don&#8217;t even read, or click it and close the email immediately do you get in a day?

I bet a ton.

**Which means two things:**

  1. Consumers are jaded, they&#8217;re used to junk emails.
  2. Clearly it still works because you&#8217;re still being sent them.

On the other hand&#8230;

**You probably check just about any Facebook messages you receive right?<img class="alignleft wp-image-1390 size-full" src="https://www.coltonrandolph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/im-email-infographic-760.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="2110" srcset="http://www.coltonrandolph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/im-email-infographic-760.jpg 760w, http://www.coltonrandolph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/im-email-infographic-760-108x300.jpg 108w, http://www.coltonrandolph.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/im-email-infographic-760-700x1943.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" />**

The reason being is simple, messaging is much more personal.

Be that from a business or a person, it feels more intimiate, connected.

There&#8217;s something about seeing &#8220;you have a new message&#8221;&#8230;

That&#8217;s just way more inticing than &#8220;you have a new email.

One makes you think &#8220;oh great, another ad.&#8221; vs. &#8220;Oh what did Colton have to say?&#8221;.

**So, is email dead? Are chat bots the future?**

Here&#8217;s the deal:

  1. Emails not dead, it&#8217;ll be around for a long time.
  2. Chat bots could be the future, but email still certainly has a place.

You most likely will get better engagements with chat bots.

But, at the same time chat bots carry a much bigger risk.

Facebook, or any platform, could shut down your account at any moment.

You could lose all of your hard work in a snap.

(It&#8217;s happened to many of my marketing friends too.)

Plus, they&#8217;ve stopped their messaging service for businesses overnight before, too.

Facebook is extremely strict on whats allowed in your messages as well.

Email on the other hand, you own that list&#8230; forever.

No one can take away your list.

You earned that email.

It&#8217;s your data.

Worst case scenario, you can just move email marketing platforms.

**So, really here&#8217;s what you should do:**

Don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket.

Use both of them.

Why limit yourself?

Get as much exposure for your brand as possible.

Go for both an email opt-in, and a messenger opt-in.
