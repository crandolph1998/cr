Look, I know.

There&#8217;s software, and tools every where.

Every tool telling you it&#8217;s the next best shiny thing you NEED.

In this post, I&#8217;ll keep it simple and straight forward.

You&#8217;ll see the 7 best tools for consultants, coaches, agencies, and experts.

Whether that be a business consultant, or a life coach (and beyond) &#8212; these are the best tools for you.

### Tool #1

### ClickFunnels

[ClickFunnels](https://clickfunnels.com/?cf_affiliate_id=451364&affiliate_id=451364) is a landing page creator, with a drag and drop editor.

It has about everything you need (depending on the plan you select).

If you select the highest plan, you&#8217;ll also have an auto-responder for email marketing.

Over all it&#8217;s very simple to use.

It clearly works well because of the sheer volume of people who use it and how fast it&#8217;s growing.

Over all if you want a simple route to websites, sales funnels, checkout pages, and email marketing.

I would recommend it.

### Tool #2

### A Good Website Host, And WordPress.

Any business needs a reliable website.

And a ton of consulting, coaching, agencies, and experts rely on WordPress.

What is WordPress? It&#8217;s a content management system & ecosystem that makes managing and building your site, funnels, and blogs easy.

Ideally, even if you do use ClickFunnels for funnels and landing pages, you should probably have at least have a WordPress blog.

If you&#8217;re on a budget, or for whatever reason you don&#8217;t want to use ClickFunnels, you&#8217;ll want to also buy a page builder for WordPress (more on that in tool #3).

Or, even if you don&#8217;t use ClickFunnels at all and you solely use WordPress (or any other CMS)&#8230;

You still need a reliable website host.

[For that, I recommend Blue Host.](https://www.bluehost.com/track/randolphorg/)

They&#8217;ve been around years, they&#8217;re reliable, and they&#8217;ll be here for years.

One click WordPress installs, no coding, all of that jazz.

Simply stated, they get the job done.

### Tool #3

### If You Go The WordPress Route, A Good Page Builder (OptimizePress).

When you don&#8217;t use ClickFunnels, you&#8217;ll need a decent page builder.

If you are really on a budget and can&#8217;t afford ClickFunnels lowest $97/mo package, then [WordPress + Optimize Press](https://coltonrandolph98--optimize.thrivecart.com/optimizepress/) is a good option.

Optimize Press is only a one time payment of as low as $97.

And has been around years&#8230;

Used by tons of huge entrepreneurs.

So certainly, a safe bet as well.

### Tool #4

### A Good Email Marketing Tool & Marketing Automation (ConvertKit).

(NOTE: Convert Kit is rebranding to Seva. Same software, new name.)

Personally, [I use and recommend ConvertKit for email marketing & marketing automation](https://mbsy.co/convertkit/38674770).

Every business needs an autoresponder.

There&#8217;s alternatives like Drip out there, but ConvertKit is a bit cheaper and I personally like it better.

This is a great tool to combine with either WordPress or ClickFunnels.

Your business will need marketing automation that ConvertKit provides if you want to survive.

### Tool #5

### A Calender Booking Page (ScheduleOnce).

Any one running a consulting, coaching, agency, or expert based business will need to schedule strategy calls.

You need a reliable way to integrate call bookings with your calender.

[That&#8217;s where ScheduleOnce comes in](https://www.scheduleonce.com/).

A simple, easy to use Calender and booking page, that starts at $9.

[<img class="alignnone" src="https://cdn.scheduleonce.com/images/newsiteImages/scheduleonce-logo.png" alt="scheduleonce" />](https://scheduleonce.com)

### Tool #6

### Google Analytics.

This ones pretty much a given for any business, but the same applies here.

You need to keep track of your visits, conversions, and total stats.

Google Analytics is a free solution that allows you to do just that.

You need to know your numbers, period.

So you&#8217;ll need to setup [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and embed your pixel on your site and funnels.  
[<img class="alignnone" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRj8s1Eu-h2fe7F10WLUVx0MLHqUu-cgYlW1Tcqmc_cxzz3Lx29" alt="google analytics" />](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)

### Tool #7

### Trello.

Trello is a totally free organization system.

It&#8217;ll help you manage your projects and time.

Schedule your projects and to-do-lists into understandable blocks of time.

Organize your business.

It&#8217;s really important for staying focused and dialing in on what you need to do.

[Any business or entrepreneur should use Trello](https://trello.com).
