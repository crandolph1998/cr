No you goof ball, Colton Randolph isn&#8217;t a scam.

But here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll say: people who want to find a reason for something to not work, they usually do.

If you&#8217;re that type of person, we&#8217;re probably not a good fit for whatever reason your googling that.

Stop being a skeptical sally.
