I‚Äôd go as far to say as 50% of marketers don‚Äôt utilize this form of advertising.

I‚Äôve seen it time after time again, and after improving their sales funnels the returns are massive.

What‚Äôs ‚Äúthis form of advertising‚Äù you may be asking yourself right now

Simple. Retargeting.

Yep. Just throwing a simple ad up on someones timeline after they left your site.

**Why is this so effective?**

That‚Äôs simple too. Most people only need a tiny little push over the edge and they‚Äôll fall right down your sales funnel.

Most people are on the fence for that one thing you just offered them, at least 50%. No matter if that is an opt-in, a tripwire offer, or an upfront purchase.

They‚Äôre on the fence. They just need the tiniest tap and they‚Äôll slide right down your sales funnel.

All you need to do is make your presence known, your face on their timeline, and keep your brand in their minds.

It truly is that simple, the copy doesn‚Äôt even need to be spectacular. It‚Äôs usually just a case of saying, ‚ÄúHey are you sure you don‚Äôt want this?‚Äù

And then as they‚Äôre drooling over your offer they come back, okay maybe not drooling, but they usually do come back.

Retargeting is so effective because it focuses on people who already know your brand. They‚Äôre not cold leads anymore, they‚Äôre slightly warm leads. Maybe even hot leads depending on how much value you‚Äôve already provided to them.

_This is a second chance to convert a visitor_

**Retargeting&nbsp;creates an illusion of grandeur**

When people see your ads everywhere, they gain trust for you. It screams ‚Äúprofitable business that knows what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù it builds more than all, authority. People think your running a perfect advertising campaign.

It‚Äôs important to understand here that retargeting is major for brand awareness. Even if it isn‚Äôt short term immediate conversions.

**My highest ROI advertising campaigns all come from retargeting**

That should say something alone. And it‚Äôs not only me. The vast majority of experienced marketers all understand marketing is a key feature to any well performing sales funnel.

If your not retargeting‚Ä¶ your ROI is probably lacking.

Not only can you put that pixel on your thank you page (so you can get a list of highly qualified leads) but you can also put it on your first upsell page, and if they take that upsell but don‚Äôt take your second upsell‚Ä¶ guess what? Retarget, retarget, retarget.

**The key take away?**

Everyone says your first impression counts most, but that‚Äôs not really true when you can retarget your visitors a second, third, fourth, and fifth time.

In the world of competitive digital marketing, you can‚Äôt really afford to NOT retarget.

So‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs safe to say after reading this you should go create a retargeting campaign right now. Something as simple of as a 25% limited time discount will work wonders for any offer. Don‚Äôt underestimate the wonders of the simplest retargeting campaign.

Now, you&#8217;re ready to kill it with retargeting.
